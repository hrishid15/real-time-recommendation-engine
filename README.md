# Real-time Recommendation Engine

A high-performance, real-time recommendation system built in Python featuring hybrid machine learning algorithms, intelligent caching, and sub-100ms response times.

## Features

- **Hybrid ML Algorithms**: Combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for optimal recommendations
- **Real-time Learning**: Updates user preferences instantly from interactions and ratings
- **Lightning-fast Performance**: Sub-100ms response times using intelligent multi-layer caching
- **Interactive User Interface**: Command-line shell for easy testing and demonstration
- **REST API**: HTTP endpoints for integration with external applications
- **Adaptive Strategy Selection**: Automatically chooses best algorithm based on available data
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time cache statistics and response time tracking

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Finds users with similar preferences and recommends items they liked
- **Content-based Filtering**: Recommends items similar to what users have previously rated highly  
- **Hybrid Engine**: Intelligently combines both approaches with dynamic weighting
- **Memory Cache**: Multi-layer caching system for instant data retrieval
- **HTTP API Server**: RESTful endpoints for all recommendation operations

### Performance Strategy

- **Precomputation**: Popular items and item similarities calculated at startup
- **Smart Caching**: Different TTL values for different data types (user recs: 5min, item similarity: 24hr)
- **Cache Invalidation**: Real-time updates clear stale recommendations when users interact
- **Batch Optimization**: Cache extra recommendations to handle varying request sizes

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-recommendation-engine.git
cd real-time-recommendation-engine
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Start the system:
```bash
python main.py
```

5. Choose option 1 to start the complete system (server + interactive shell)

## Usage

### Interactive Shell

The system includes a user-friendly shell interface:

```bash
python main.py
> 1  # Start system

# Login options:
- alice (likes Apple products)
- bob (likes tech + gaming)  
- carol (likes cooking)
- Create new user
```

**Available commands:**
- **Get recommendations**: Personalized suggestions based on user history
- **Rate items**: Provide feedback that immediately updates future recommendations
- **Browse categories**: Explore items by electronics, kitchen, furniture, books
- **Find similar items**: Discover products similar to specific items
- **View popular items**: See trending products overall or by category
- **Performance stats**: Monitor cache hit rates and response times

### REST API

The system exposes HTTP endpoints for external integration:

```bash
# Get recommendations
curl http://localhost:8000/recommendations/alice?count=5

# Record user interaction
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/interactions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"user_id": "alice", "item_id": "iphone", "rating": 5}'

# Find similar items
curl http://localhost:8000/similar/iphone?count=3

# Get popular items
curl http://localhost:8000/popular?category=electronics&count=10

# System health and stats
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/stats
```

## API Reference

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/recommendations/{user_id}` | Get personalized recommendations |
| POST | `/interactions` | Record user rating/interaction |
| GET | `/similar/{item_id}` | Find items similar to given item |
| GET | `/popular` | Get popular items (optionally by category) |
| GET | `/health` | Service health check |
| GET | `/stats` | Performance statistics |

### Example Responses

**Get Recommendations:**
```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    {"item": "ipad", "score": 0.856, "strategy": "hybrid"},
    {"item": "airpods", "score": 0.742, "strategy": "content"}
  ],
  "user_id": "alice",
  "source": "cache",
  "response_time_ms": "1.23"
}
```

**Record Interaction:**
```json
{
  "user_id": "alice",
  "item_id": "gaming_chair", 
  "rating": 5,
  "status": "recorded",
  "cache_invalidated": true,
  "response_time_ms": "0.45"
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Cache Hit Response Time**: <5ms
- **Cache Miss Response Time**: <100ms  
- **Real-time Updates**: User interactions processed in <1ms
- **Typical Cache Hit Rate**: 80-90% in production scenarios
- **Concurrent Users**: Designed to handle thousands of simultaneous users

## Technical Implementation

### Machine Learning Algorithms

**Collaborative Filtering:**
- Uses cosine similarity to find users with similar preferences
- Predicts ratings based on similar users' preferences
- Handles cold start with popularity-based fallback

**Content-based Filtering:**
- TF-IDF vectorization of item features (category, brand, description)
- Builds user profiles from historical interactions
- Recommends items with similar feature vectors

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Dynamic weighting based on data availability
- New users: 70% content-based, 30% collaborative
- Experienced users: 50% collaborative, 50% content-based
- Heavy users: 70% collaborative, 30% content-based

### Caching Strategy

| Data Type | Cache Duration | Reasoning |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| User Recommendations | 5 minutes | Updates frequently with new interactions |
| User Profiles | 1 hour | Stable preferences change gradually |
| Item Similarities | 24 hours | Very stable relationships |
| Popular Items | 30 minutes | Trends shift throughout the day |

## Demo Data
